# Kubernetes Cluster Health Checker and Auto-Healing

An automated health monitoring and self-healing tool for Kubernetes clusters. It detects common issues — failed pods, unresponsive nodes, resource pressure — and takes corrective action automatically, reducing the manual overhead for small DevOps teams managing large-scale clusters.

## Problem statement

Manually monitoring and troubleshooting Kubernetes clusters is time-consuming and error-prone, especially for small teams managing large deployments. This project automates detection and recovery of common failure modes to improve availability and reduce operator burden.

## Goals

1. Automated health monitoring of node health, pod status, and resource utilization.
2. Self-healing actions: pod restarts, rescheduling, and scaling to balance workloads.
3. Real-time alerts and notifications for issues requiring manual intervention.
4. A web dashboard showing live health status, historical data, and auto-healing logs.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Core service | Go | Kubernetes API interaction, performance-critical logic |
| Scripting | Python | Data processing, glue scripts |
| Cluster control | Kubernetes API (client-go) | Read/write access to nodes, pods, deployments |
| Metrics | Prometheus | Cluster and application metric collection |
| Visualization | Grafana | Real-time and historical dashboards |
| Alerting | Alertmanager | Threshold-based alert routing |
| Notifications | Slack API | Delivering alerts to the DevOps team |
| Packaging | Docker | Containerizing the service for deployment |
